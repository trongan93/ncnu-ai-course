NCNU AI Course
Material and Code Simulation
Week 1:
The instructional team has a few extra recommendations to help with tackling the python projects if you are new to python. We recommend starting with the quizzes for the course which are more conceptual while learning python in parallel.
If you choose to do this and learn python in parallel, here are a few beginner courses that could help with learning python: 
A Byte of Python (https://python.swaroopch.com/)
The Python Tutorial (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)
We recommend focusing on the following topics which are more relevant to the projects in this course:
Data structures: lists, queues, stacks, trees, dictionaries
Concepts: classes, object-oriented programming, recursion
