    "\"\"\"\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "There are generally two ways to distribute computation across multiple devices:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data parallelism**, where a single model gets replicated on multiple devices or\n",
    "multiple machines. Each of them processes different batches of data, then they merge\n",
    "their results. There exist many variant of this setup, that differ in how the different\n",
    "model replicas merge results, in whether they stay in sync at every batch or whether they\n",
    "are more loosely coupled, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model parallelism**, where different parts of a single model run on difference devices,\n",
    "processing a single batch of data together. This works best with models that have a\n",
    "naturally-parallel architecture, such as models that feature multiple branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide focuses on data parallelism, in particular **synchronous data parallelism**,\n",
    "where the different replicas of the model stay in sync after each batch they process.\n",
    "Synchronicity keeps the model convergence behavior identical to what you would see for\n",
    "single-device training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, this guide teaches you how to use the `tf.distribute` API to train Keras\n",
    "models on multiple GPUs, with minimal changes to your code, in the following two setups:\n",
    "\n",
    "- On multiple GPUs (typically 2 to 8) installed on a single machine (single host,\n",
    "multi-device training). This is the most common setup for researchers and small-scale\n",
    "industry workflows.\n",
    "- On a cluster of many machines, each hosting one or multiple GPUs (multi-worker\n",
    "distributed training). This is a good setup for large-scale industry workflows, e.g.\n",
    "training high-resolution image classification models on tens of millions of images using\n",
    "20-100 GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "from tensorflow import keras\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "## Single-host, multi-device synchronous training\n",
    "\n",
    "In this setup, you have one machine with several GPUs on it (typically 2 to 8). Each\n",
    "device will run a copy of your model (called a **replica**). For simplicity, in what\n",
    "follows, we'll asume we're dealing with 8 GPUs, at no loss of generality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works**\n",
    "\n",
    "At each step of training:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The current batch of data (called **global batch**) is split into 8 different\n",
    "sub-batches (called **local batches**). For instance, if the global batch has 512\n",
    "samples, each of the 8 local batches will have 64 samples.\n",
    "- Each of the 8 replicas independently processes a local batch: they run a forward pass,\n",
    "then a backward pass, outputting the gradient of the weights with respect to the loss of\n",
    "the model on the local batch.\n",
    "- The weight updates originating from local gradients are efficiently merged across the 8\n",
    "replicas. Because this is done at the end of every step, the replicas always stay in\n",
    "sync.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the process of synchronously updating the weights of the model replicas is\n",
    "handled at level of each individual weight variable. This is done through a **mirrored\n",
    "variable** object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to use it**\n",
    "\n",
    "To do single-host, multi-device synchronous training with a Keras model, you would use\n",
    "the [`tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy` API](\n",
    "    https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/MirroredStrategy).\n",
    "Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instantiate a `MirroredStrategy`, optionally configuring which specific devices you\n",
    "want to use (by default the strategy will use all GPUs available).\n",
    "- Use the strategy object to open a scope, and within this scope, create all the Keras\n",
    "objects you need that contain variables. Typically, that means **creating & compiling the\n",
    "model** inside the distribution scope.\n",
    "- Train the model via `fit()` as usual.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, we recommend that you use `tf.data.Dataset` objects to load data\n",
    "in a multi-device or distributed workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schematically, it looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create a MirroredStrategy.\n",
    "strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()\n",
    "print('Number of devices: {}'.format(strategy.num_replicas_in_sync))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open a strategy scope.\n",
    "with strategy.scope():\n",
    "  # Everything that creates variables should be under the strategy scope.\n",
    "  # In general this is only model construction & `compile()`.\n",
    "  model = Model(...)\n",
    "  model.compile(...)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Train the model on all available devices.\n",
    "model.fit(train_dataset, validation_data=val_dataset, ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Test the model on all available devices.\n",
    "model.evaluate(test_dataset)\n",
    "```\n",
