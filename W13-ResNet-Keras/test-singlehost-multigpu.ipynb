    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "There are generally two ways to distribute computation across multiple devices:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data parallelism**, where a single model gets replicated on multiple devices or\n",
    "multiple machines. Each of them processes different batches of data, then they merge\n",
    "their results. There exist many variant of this setup, that differ in how the different\n",
    "model replicas merge results, in whether they stay in sync at every batch or whether they\n",
    "are more loosely coupled, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model parallelism**, where different parts of a single model run on difference devices,\n",
    "processing a single batch of data together. This works best with models that have a\n",
    "naturally-parallel architecture, such as models that feature multiple branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide focuses on data parallelism, in particular **synchronous data parallelism**,\n",
    "where the different replicas of the model stay in sync after each batch they process.\n",
    "Synchronicity keeps the model convergence behavior identical to what you would see for\n",
    "single-device training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, this guide teaches you how to use the `tf.distribute` API to train Keras\n",
    "models on multiple GPUs, with minimal changes to your code, in the following two setups:\n",
    "\n",
    "- On multiple GPUs (typically 2 to 8) installed on a single machine (single host,\n",
    "multi-device training). This is the most common setup for researchers and small-scale\n",
    "industry workflows.\n",
    "- On a cluster of many machines, each hosting one or multiple GPUs (multi-worker\n",
    "distributed training). This is a good setup for large-scale industry workflows, e.g.\n",
    "training high-resolution image classification models on tens of millions of images using\n",
    "20-100 GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "from tensorflow import keras\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "## Single-host, multi-device synchronous training\n",
    "\n",
    "In this setup, you have one machine with several GPUs on it (typically 2 to 8). Each\n",
    "device will run a copy of your model (called a **replica**). For simplicity, in what\n",
    "follows, we'll asume we're dealing with 8 GPUs, at no loss of generality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works**\n",
    "\n",
    "At each step of training:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The current batch of data (called **global batch**) is split into 8 different\n",
    "sub-batches (called **local batches**). For instance, if the global batch has 512\n",
    "samples, each of the 8 local batches will have 64 samples.\n",
    "- Each of the 8 replicas independently processes a local batch: they run a forward pass,\n",
    "then a backward pass, outputting the gradient of the weights with respect to the loss of\n",
    "the model on the local batch.\n",
    "- The weight updates originating from local gradients are efficiently merged across the 8\n",
    "replicas. Because this is done at the end of every step, the replicas always stay in\n",
    "sync.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the process of synchronously updating the weights of the model replicas is\n",
    "handled at level of each individual weight variable. This is done through a **mirrored\n",
    "variable** object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to use it**\n",
    "\n",
    "To do single-host, multi-device synchronous training with a Keras model, you would use\n",
    "the [`tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy` API](\n",
    "    https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/MirroredStrategy).\n",
    "Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instantiate a `MirroredStrategy`, optionally configuring which specific devices you\n",
    "want to use (by default the strategy will use all GPUs available).\n",
    "- Use the strategy object to open a scope, and within this scope, create all the Keras\n",
    "objects you need that contain variables. Typically, that means **creating & compiling the\n",
    "model** inside the distribution scope.\n",
    "- Train the model via `fit()` as usual.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, we recommend that you use `tf.data.Dataset` objects to load data\n",
    "in a multi-device or distributed workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schematically, it looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create a MirroredStrategy.\n",
    "strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()\n",
    "print('Number of devices: {}'.format(strategy.num_replicas_in_sync))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open a strategy scope.\n",
    "with strategy.scope():\n",
    "  # Everything that creates variables should be under the strategy scope.\n",
    "  # In general this is only model construction & `compile()`.\n",
    "  model = Model(...)\n",
    "  model.compile(...)\n",
    "\n",

    "## `tf.data` performance tips\n",
    "\n",
    "When doing distributed training, the efficiency with which you load data can often become\n",
    "critical. Here are a few tips to make sure your `tf.data` pipelines\n",
    "run as fast as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note about dataset batching**\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating your dataset, make sure it is batched with the global batch size.\n",
    "For instance, if each of your 8 GPUs is capable of running a batch of 64 samples, you\n",
    "call use a global batch size of 512.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calling `dataset.cache()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you call `.cache()` on a dataset, its data will be cached after running through the\n",
    "first iteration over the data. Every subsequent iteration will used the cached data. The\n",
    "cache can be in memory (default) or to a local file you specify.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can improve performance when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your data is not expected to change from iteration to iteration\n",
    "- You are reading data from a remote distributed filesystem\n",
    "- You are reading data from local disk, but your data would fit in memory and your\n",
    "workflow is significantly IO-bound (e.g. reading & decoding image files).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calling `dataset.prefetch(buffer_size)`**\n",
    "\n",
    "You should almost always call `.prefetch(buffer_size)` after creating a dataset. It means\n",
    "your data pipeline will run asynchronously from your model,\n",

    "\n",
    "**How it works**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this setup, you have multiple machines (called **workers**), each with one or several\n",
    "GPUs on them. Much like what happens for single-host training,\n",
    "each available GPU will run one model replica, and the value of the variables of each\n",
    "replica is kept in sync after each batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, the current implementation assumes that all workers have the same number of\n",
    "GPUs (homogeneous cluster).\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to use it**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up a cluster (we provide pointers below).\n",
    "2. Set up an appropriate `TF_CONFIG` environment variable on each worker. This tells the\n",
    "worker what its role is and how to communicate with its peers.\n",
    "3. On each worker, run your model construction & compilation code within the scope of a\n",
    "[`MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` object](\n",
    "    https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/experimental/MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy),\n",
    "similarly to we did for single-host training.\n",
    "4. Run evaluation code on a designated evaluator machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setting up a cluster**\n",
    "\n",
    "First, set up a cluster (collective of machines). Each machine individually should be\n",
    "setup so as to be able to run your model (typically, each machine will run the same\n",
    "Docker image) and to able to access your data source (e.g. GCS).\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster management is beyond the scope of this guide.\n",
    "[Here is a document](\n",
    "    https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/training/docs/distributed-training-containers)\n",
    "to help you get started.\n",
    "You can also take a look at [Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setting up the `TF_CONFIG` environment variable**\n",
    "\n",
    "While the code running on each worker is almost the same as the code used in the\n",
    "single-host workflow (except with a different `tf.distribute` strategy object), one\n",
    "significant difference between the single-host workflow and the multi-worker workflow is\n",
    "that you need to set a `TF_CONFIG` environment variable on each machine running in your\n",
    "cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `TF_CONFIG` environment variable is a JSON string that specifies:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the multi-worker synchronous training setup, valid roles (task types) for the machines\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, if you have 8 machines with 4 GPUs each, you could have 7 workers and one\n",
    "evaluator.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The workers train the model, each one processing sub-batches of a global batch.\n",
    "- One of the workers (worker 0) will serve as \"chief\", a particular kind of worker that\n",

    "storage location).\n",
    "- The evaluator runs a continuous loop that loads the latest checkpoint saved by the\n",

    "except using `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` instead of `MirroredStrategy`.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Note:** Callbacks that save model checkpoints or logs should save to a different\n",
